    <h2>TUYF Charitable Trust Fund Scholarship</h2>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Please introduce yourself and tell us about your studies, research, and/or interests in epidemiology</h3>
      <p>A: From classrooms to real-world impact, my journey at the Department of Epidemiology has shaped who I am today. I’m Phonchai Thongwichian, an M.Sc. (Epidemiology) student at the Department of Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University. My dissertation research focuses on cannabis and other substance use among high school adolescents following the decriminalization of cannabis in Thailand. Providing evidence-based information is crucial to help stakeholders and policymakers understand the effects of this policy on a vulnerable population and to guide their actions in the context of a policy that lacks comprehensive control measures. Epidemiological concepts and methods enable me to investigate and generate such information. Moreover, these core principles are essential to support my professional responsibilities and help achieve the goals of my organization. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Why did you choose PSU for your graduate studies in epidemiology?</h3>
      <p>A: The Department of Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University (PSU), is well known for its graduate programs in epidemiology. The department has faculty members with strong expertise and extensive experience in my area of research interest, providing valuable support and guidance for conducting research. Additionally, the department maintains academic collaborations with various sectors, both nationally and especially at the international level. Its diverse student body-with varied backgrounds, expertise, and affiliations-also offers an excellent opportunity for networking and future collaboration. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: What are your future academic/career plans?</h3>
      <p>A: I will return to my position as a Public Health Technical Officer at the Office of Disease Prevention and Control Region 12, Songkhla, under the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. The knowledge, skills, and network I have gained during the course will serve as valuable tools to support the organization’s missions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: In your opinion, how has the TUYF Scholarship contributed to your success during your studies?</h3>

Moreover, the scholarship offered valuable opportunities to attend academic conferences, gain hands-on experience through fieldwork, and participate in activities organized for grantees.
