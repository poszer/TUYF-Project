      <h3>Q: Please introduce yourself and tell us about your studies, research, and/or interests in epidemiology</h3>
      <p>A: Hi, this is Kazi Fayzus Salahin from Bangladesh, and I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Department of Epidemiology at the Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Thailand. My academic and professional journey blends my foundation of statistics with over a decade of experience in public health research and monitoring & evaluation. My research and professional work focus on data-driven approaches to improve community health, particularly in low-resources urban settings. My research interest spans health system strengthening and evaluation, evidence-based decision-making, immunization equity, vaccination policy and advocy, urban health, behavioral health, and statistical modeling using both classical and machine learning methods.
My doctoral thesis, titled “Stakeholders' Engagement on Evidence-Based Decision-Making on Interventions for Vaccination in Children Aged 12–23 Months in Slum Areas of Bangladesh: A Mixed-Method Model,” focuses on improving childhood vaccination coverage in urban slums. The study integrates systematic review, stakeholder consultations, multicriteria decision analysis (using the WHO iEtD framework and TOPSIS-Entropy), and qualitative research to assess feasible, sustainable, and impactful interventions. This work not only identifies key barriers to vaccination but also provides practical, scalable intervention that bridge research, policy, and real-world implementation. </p>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Why did you choose PSU for your graduate studies in epidemiology?</h3>
      <p>A: I chose Prince of Songkla University (PSU) because of its outstanding reputation in public health, particularly in applied epidemiology. Moreover, PSU committed to solve the real-world health challenges on the regional and global perspectives. It nurtures a unique environment where academic training meets practical implementation, something I highly value. The opportunity to work under the mentorship of globally recognized and respected faculty members and engage with diverse research collaborations across the world made PSU the ideal place for me to deepen my skills in applied research and problem solving ability. PSU is the hub of the professional network that fosters a researcher’s career and provides the infrastructure to explore and enrich both research capacity and professional vision.</p>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: What are your future academic/career plans?</h3>
      <p>A: My plan is to continue working at the intersection of epidemiological research, policy translation, and program evaluation, with a focus on improving public health outcomes including urban health, behavioral health, and digital health innovations for vulnerable and deprived populations, particularly in urban areas. My long-term aims are to contribute regional and global health research to support governments and development partners for designing, implementing, and evaluating impactful public health programs. I also hope to contribute to academic teaching and mentoring, particularly on policy advocacy, machine learning applications in healthcare, and epidemiological modeling to public health challenges such vaccination, maternal health, non-communicable diseases, and climate-related health risks empowering data-driven decisions for underserved populations.</p>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: In your opinion, how has the TUYF Scholarship contributed to your success during your studies?</h3>
      <p>A: The TUYF Scholarship has played a vital role in my Ph.D. journey. It has provided not only financial support but also the peace of mind and stability that is necessary to focus entirely on my studies and research. The scholarship helps me to attend international conferences and contribute to scientific publications without the added burden of financial constraints. More importantly, it has motivated me to uphold the values of academic excellence, leadership, and community service that the scholarship represents.</p>
