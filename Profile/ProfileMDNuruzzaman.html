    <h2>TUYF Charitable Trust Fund Scholarship</h2>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Please introduce yourself and tell us about your studies, research, and/or interests in epidemiology</h3>
      <p>A: My name is Md. Nuruzzaman, a Ph.D. student in Epidemiology (International Program) at the Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University (Student ID: 6510330002). I am from Bangladesh. My current Ph.D. research is titled as “Rubella Vaccination Rate, Vaccination Acceptance and Prevalence of Seropositivity among Young Female Adults in Garment Factories in Bangladesh.” The study aims to inform vaccination strategies and policy interventions in low-resource settings. I have over 15 years of professional experience as a Public Health Researcher and Analyst, with academic training in Anthropology and Public Health. I am deeply interested in vaccine-preventable diseases, health systems, WASH, SRHR, and the epidemiology of infectious diseases.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Why did you choose PSU for your graduate studies in epidemiology?</h3>
      <p>A: I chose Prince of Songkla University (PSU) for its strong reputation in public health and epidemiology research. I found that the department of Epidemiology is a WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Epidemiology that emphasizes on international collaboration and translational research that made it the ideal place to further my academic and professional development. The Faculty of Medicine at PSU offers a dynamic and supportive environment, with highly experienced faculty members and a curriculum that balances theoretical knowledge with practical application. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude that I have received the valuable support of the TUYF Charitable Trust Fund through this institute.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: What are your future academic/career plans?</h3>
      <p>A: After completing my Ph.D., I plan to continue working in public health research and policy, focusing on strengthening immunization programs, improving maternal and child health services, and addressing health inequities in low- and middle-income countries. I aim to engage in collaborative research and work closely with government agencies, NGOs, and global health organizations to translate evidence into actionable policies and interventions. Additionally, I hope to contribute to academic teaching and mentoring.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: In your opinion, how has the TUYF Scholarship contributed to your success during your studies?</h3>
      <p>A: The TUYF Scholarship has significantly supported my academic journey by alleviating financial burdens, allowing me to fully concentrate on my coursework and research. This support has enabled me to access essential resources, attend academic seminars and workshops, and focus on conducting fieldwork in Bangladesh for my Ph.D. study. Without this scholarship, it was not possible to carry out my studies and research.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Would you like to say a few words to prospective Scholarship applicants?</h3>
      <p>A: I would say: apply with confidence. The TUYF Scholarship is more than a financial support—it is an investment to the public health professionals with Research Capacity Building through Education and Networking. The engaging and motivational activities carried by the TUYF Scholarship committee for the students are really exceptional to me. </p>
