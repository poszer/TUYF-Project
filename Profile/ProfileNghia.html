    <h2>TUYF Charitable Trust Fund Scholarship</h2>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Please introduce yourself and tell us about your studies, research, and/or interests in epidemiology</h3>
      <p>A: My name is Dang Quoc Nghia, currently a researcher fellow at the Health Strategy and Policy Institute (HSPI), Ministry of Health, Vietnam. I have been involved in various research projects focusing on medical devices, human resources for health, universal health coverage, and clinical pharmacy...</p>
      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; In 2025, I began my Master’s program in Epidemiology at Prince of Songkla University (PSU), Thailand, with the support of the TUYF Charitable Trust Fund Scholarship. My academic interest lies in applying epidemiological methods to health policy research and improving data-driven decision-making in public health systems.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Why did you choose PSU for your graduate studies in epidemiology?</h3>
      <p>A: I chose PSU because of its strong academic reputation in public health and epidemiology, particularly in Southeast Asia. The faculty members are highly experienced in both quantitative and applied epidemiological research. The university also offers a culturally diverse and collaborative environment, which is ideal for professional and personal growth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Historically, my institute has a tradition of collaborating with PSU in Thailand. At Prince of Songkla University, three of my colleagues have studied and advanced their expertise. After completing their studies, they effectively applied their knowledge to their work, received high evaluations from leadership, and contributed to the institute's development.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: What are your future academic/career plans?</h3>
      <p>A: After completing my Master's degree, I plan to return to Vietnam and continue my work as a researcher at HSPI. My long-term goal is to become an expert in health policy and epidemiology, contributing to the development and evaluation of public health interventions and policies. I also aim to pursue a PhD in the future and publish research that informs health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: In your opinion, how has the TUYF Scholarship contributed to your success during your studies?</h3>
      <p>A: The TUYF Scholarship has been instrumental in enabling me to pursue graduate studies abroad without financial burden. It helps open up many opportunities for me to participate in academic and research activities, including coursework, seminars, collaborative projects, and potential fieldwork or publications. The scholarship not only supports my education financially but also motivates me to excel and give back to the public health community through meaningful work.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Would you like to say a few words to prospective Scholarship applicants?</h3>
      <p>A: I highly encourage future applicants to apply for the TUYF Scholarship. It is a valuable opportunity to pursue advanced education and make a meaningful impact in your country’s health system. Be clear about your goals, stay committed to public service, and take full advantage of the academic and networking opportunities that come with this support. This scholarship is not only a financial aid but also a recognition of your potential to contribute to public health.</p>
