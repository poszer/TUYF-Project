    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Please introduce yourself and tell us about your studies, research, and/or interests in epidemiology</h3>
      <p>A: My name is Ricvan Dana Nindrea, and I hold a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Epidemiology from the Department of Epidemiology at Prince of Songkla University (PSU). I am a lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Negeri Padang, and a researcher at Dr. M. Djamil General Central Hospital in Padang. My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in the principles of epidemiology and public health. During my studies, I focused on public health research, particularly in understanding health behaviors and their implications for disease prevention.</p>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Why did you choose PSU for your graduate studies in epidemiology?</h3>
      <p>A: I chose PSU for my graduate studies in epidemiology because of its strong reputation in the field of public health and epidemiology, particularly in Southeast Asia. PSU’s Department of Epidemiology offers a comprehensive curriculum that combines both theoretical knowledge and practical research skills. The faculty members are highly experienced, and their research aligns closely with my own interests, especially in the areas of disease prevention and health behavior. Additionally, the diverse student body and international research collaborations at PSU provide a stimulating academic environment that fosters global perspectives on public health issues. The opportunity to study at PSU has been instrumental in shaping my academic and professional path, providing me with the tools and knowledge necessary to pursue a career in epidemiology.</p>

      <h3>Q: What are your future academic/career plans?</h3>
      <p>A: My future academic and career plans involve further developing my expertise in epidemiology and public health, with a specific focus on nutrition, infectious diseases, and health behavior research. I am particularly interested in how nutrition interventions can be tailored to different communities to improve health outcomes and reduce the burden of chronic diseases. Additionally, I am committed to contributing to academia by teaching and mentoring the next generation of epidemiologists.</p>
