    <h2>TUYF Charitable Trust Fund Scholarship</h2>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Please introduce yourself and tell us about your studies, research, and/or interests in epidemiology</h3>
      <p>A: My name is Yanxu Zhong,  I received my PhD in Epidemiology from Prince of Songkla University (PSU) between 2020 and 2024. I currently work at the Department of Non-Communicable Disease Control at Guangxi CDC in China. My research focuses on environmental epidemiology, chronic disease prevention, and maternal and child health. My doctoral dissertation was a cohort study investigating the effects of aflatoxin exposure on pregnancy outcomes. I’m particularly interested in identifying early biomarkers of risk and developing practical prevention strategies that suit local populations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Why did you choose PSU for your graduate studies in epidemiology?</h3>
      <p>A: I chose PSU because its flexible, practice-oriented learning model was a perfect fit for my background and academic goals. It helped me bridge technical gaps in my professional field while allowing me to experience the joy of internationalized education. The academic environment at PSU—rigorous yet supportive—greatly enhanced both my knowledge and research capacity, and I truly enjoyed the journey. I fortunate to make many friends, both seniors and juniors, who helped me grow beyond academics by introducing me to the diverse cultures of their countries.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: What are your future academic/career plans?</h3>
      <p>A: My future plan is to establish a long-term population cohort tailored to the characteristics of the Guangxi population. I aim to explore the natural history and risk factors of chronic diseases and propose integrated prevention and control strategies through medical-prevention collaboration. I hope my research can directly support policy-making and improve public health outcomes in my region.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: In your opinion, how has the TUYF Scholarship contributed to your success during your studies?</h3>
      <p>A: The TUYF Scholarship had a vital impact on my academic journey. Although it supported me for only the final two years of my PhD (2023–2024), it made a crucial difference. My doctoral fieldwork consumed a large portion of my research budget, and my institution was unable to support tuition or research costs. At a critical moment, TUYF helped me overcome these challenges and complete my PhD successfully. It was more than financial assistance—it was a timely lifeline and a strong motivation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
      <h3>Q: Would you like to say a few words to prospective Scholarship applicants?</h3>
      <p>A: To future applicants: “There will always be a way forward when the car reaches the mountain, and the boat will naturally straighten when it reaches the bridge.” Everything happens for a reason. Believe in your choices and keep moving forward with determination. The TUYF Scholarship can be a turning point, just like it was for me. Stay confident, stay passionate, and trust yourself—you are stronger than you think.</p>
